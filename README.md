# odin-javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions

Github repository for the dynamic user interface interactions lesson from the Odin Project's JavaScript course.

This lesson was also involved using tools like ESLint and Prettier to assist in formatting JS code.

This lesson targeted three different types of common components:

1. Drop down menus
2. Mobile menus
3. Image sliders

I was tasked to create each of these reusable components with vanilla CSS and JavaScript.

Each of these components was designed with as little CSS as possible to make them function.
Users can use these components and easily add CSS of their own to style the components to match the design of their website.
